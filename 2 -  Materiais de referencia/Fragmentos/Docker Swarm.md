## üåç Docker Swarm: Scaling Beyond Single Hosts

Docker Swarm transforms Docker from a single-host container management tool to a powerful cluster orchestration platform. It allows you to treat a group of Docker hosts as a single, virtual system.

### The Cluster Management Revolution

A Docker Swarm cluster consists of manager nodes that handle the cluster's state and scheduling, and worker nodes that run the containers. This architecture provides built-in load balancing, service discovery, and rolling updates.

```bash
# Initialize a swarm
docker swarm init

# Create a service across the cluster
docker service create --replicas 5 --name web_service mywebimage

# Scale services dynamically
docker service scale web_service=10
```
