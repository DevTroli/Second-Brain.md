## What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a code-base. Instead of directly changing the main code, you submit your changes for review before they are merged.

## Basic Flow of a Pull Request

1. **Create a Branch**
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b fix-login-bug
```

2. **Make Changes**
```bash
# Make your changes, commit them and then push your branch
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation"
git push origin fix-login-bug
```

3. **Create Pull Request**
- Go to repository on GitHub/GitLab
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your branch
- Fill description
- Submit

4. **Review Process**
- Other developers review code
- Automated tests run
- Changes requested or approved
- Merged when ready

## Review Process

1. **Reviewers check for:**
- Code correctness
- Test coverage
- Security issues
- Documentation

2. **Possible Outcomes:**
- Approved
- Changes requested
- Rejected

## When to Create a PR

Create a Pull Request when:
1. Fixing a bug
2. Adding a feature
3. Updating documentation
4. Improving existing code

Don't create a PR for:
1. Unfinished code
2. Multiple unrelated changes
3. Without testing first
